ssr = server side rendered

app> layout.js ==> if you write something into layout.js, it appears into browser dom.

easy to make routing => create folder in app as you like. e.g., services, about, etc.

<Link href="/about">About</Link> ==> Next.js provide the Link tag for automatic render to e.g. /about as About Page.
